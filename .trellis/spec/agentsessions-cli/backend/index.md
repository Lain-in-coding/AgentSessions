# agentsessions-cli — Backend Guidelines

> The composition root. The only crate that binds abstract ports to concrete
> adapters and owns the human/robot-facing surface.

## Role in the architecture

`agentsessions-cli` is the **composition root** (see the hexagonal layering in
the plan §5): it is the single place that `new`s a concrete `SqliteStore` and
injects it into `App`. Every other crate is backend-agnostic. This crate also
owns the CLI argument parsing, the Robot v1 protocol envelope, and the mapping
from `AppError` to canonical error codes / exit codes.

Real files:
- `src/main.rs` — arg parsing, command dispatch, composition root, platform paths
- `src/protocol.rs` — Robot v1 envelope, `CanonicalCode` error catalog, output modes

## Pre-Development Checklist

Before writing code in this crate:

- [ ] Argument parsing is **hand-written**, no third-party CLI framework. Match
      the existing style in `main.rs` (`parse_db_flag`, `command_name`,
      `arg(rest, i, usage)`); do not introduce clap/structopt.
- [ ] Every new subcommand goes through `dispatch()` and returns
      `(&'static str command, Outcome, serde_json::Value)`. Errors return
      `CliError`, never `panic!` / `unwrap` on user input.
- [ ] Read paths use `SqliteStore::open`; write paths (`index`/`ingest`/`sync`)
      use `SqliteStore::open_for_write` to take the writer lease. Do not open a
      write connection for a read-only command.
- [ ] All output goes through `protocol::emit` / `error_envelope`. stdout carries
      **only** protocol data; human diagnostics go to stderr (plan §7.5).
- [ ] New error conditions map to an existing `CanonicalCode`. If you need a new
      code, register it in the `CanonicalCode` enum, its `as_str`, `exit_code`,
      `retryable`, **and** the published `schemas/robot/v1/error-catalog.json`
      (the schema-drift test enforces they stay in sync).

## Quality Check

Before proposing a commit for this crate:

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all --check` clean.
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean.
- [ ] `cargo test -p agentsessions-cli` green, including `tests/e2e.rs`
      (drives the real compiled binary end-to-end).
- [ ] Any protocol/envelope change is reflected in both `protocol.rs` tests and
      the `tests/e2e.rs` envelope-shape assertions.
- [ ] Exit codes match the error catalog (invalid_request → 2, not_found → 4,
      source_io/source_changed → 5, catalog/writer_busy → 6, provider → 7,
      schema_incompatible → 9, internal → 70).

**Language**: write all guideline docs in **English**.
